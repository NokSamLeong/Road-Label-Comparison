Make sure JDK and Java are installed
You can find it in the install file
if error occures when you try to run the roadLabeling.jar, reinstall JDK12 (\install\jdk-12.0.2_windows-x64_bin) 

program path: scr\roadLabeling.jar

The class files are hidden in the scr file. 
to review it, go to View(top bar) and check the hidden items.
The program was specifically designed for the road label comparison which the keys are all 16 degits 
and at most 4 different kind of labels for each key. 

Instruction
Miximum selection for each key is 2 labels.
if None is selected, no labels will be marked even if they are selected.
Do not need to delete the key string in the comend field. It is there for copying to Skymap.
Do not hit next if it shows finish, otherwish it will insert fauly data into the file.
Make sure to delete the images which you already give judgement to.
The result is saved as txt file. data is seperated by tab.
